<h1>Make a difference!</h1>

<p class="pDavid">My dear friend David has been suffering from a severe syndrome of retardedness over the years. So, now I urge the public
    to take a stance against this syndrome. Make a difference and contribute to make him and his function. He has a son which
    we all just want to be able to grow up in a somewhat normal household.</p>
