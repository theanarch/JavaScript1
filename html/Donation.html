        <p>My dear friend David has been suffering from a severe syndrome of retardedness over the years. So, now I urge the
            public to take a stance against this syndrome. Make a difference and contribute to make him and his function.
            He has a son which we all just want to be able to grow up in a somewhat normal household.</p>
