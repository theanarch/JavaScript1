    <h1>Make a difference!</h1>
    <p class="pDavid">My dear friend David has been suffering from a severe syndrome over the years, being retardedness. So, now I urge the public to take a stance against this syndrome. Make a difference and contribute to make him and his function. He has a son which we all just want to be able to grow up in a somewhat normal household.</p>
